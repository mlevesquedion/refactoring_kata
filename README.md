Source code extracted from the Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring, Improving the Design of Existing Code".

This code needs to be refactored in order to make it easy for future functionality additions. But as Boromir said, "One does not simply walk into refactoring".
You'll need to build a set of tests before refactoring anything, so you'll can verify the code's behaviour is still the same.

## Instructions

Try to understand what the code does and then start doing some unit testing with JUnit using the files allocated in the test directory.
Once you get green light you'll be able to do the refactor stuff.
